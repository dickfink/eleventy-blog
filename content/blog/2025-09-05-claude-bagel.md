# Dough

*   350g all-purpose flour
    
*   150g whole wheat flour
    
*   290g water
    
*   100g starter (66% hydration)
    
*   10g salt
    
*   **3-4g diastatic malt powder** (instead of the syrup)
    

**Method notes:**

*   Mix everything except salt first, let it sit 20-30 minutes (autolyse)
    
*   Add salt and knead well - bagel dough needs to be smooth and strong
    
*   **Bulk fermentation**: Since you know your starter and environment well from the country loaf, do a shorter bulk - maybe 2-3 hours at room temp instead of your usual 4-5. You want maybe 50-70% rise rather than the full bulk you'd do for bread.
    
    **Shape and straight to the fridge**: After bulk, shape your bagels and get them into the fridge within 30-45 minutes. Don't wait for them to puff up much at room temp.
    
    **The magic happens overnight**: 12-24 hours in the fridge will develop incredible flavor and give you a wide window for boiling/baking. The cold fermentation will slow things way down.
    
    **Next day**: Pull them straight from fridge to boiling water - no need to come to room temp first. Cold, well-fermented bagels actually hold their shape better during boiling.
    

# Boil

*   **60-90 seconds per side** for a nice chewy crust without overcooking
    
*   Start with 60 seconds if your bagels are well-fermented and holding their shape well
    
*   Go up to 90 seconds if you want extra chew or if they seem a bit under-proofed
    

**Water additions:** Since you have diastatic malt powder, I'd keep it simple:

*   **1 tablespoon baking soda** per quart of water (creates alkaline environment for better browning and classic bagel flavor)
    
*   **1 tablespoon salt** per quart of water (wtf? I doubt it)
