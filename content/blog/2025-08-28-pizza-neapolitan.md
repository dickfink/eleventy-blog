**Makes 4 Pizzas @ ~260g**

*   429g Water
    
*   613g Flour
    
*   30-60g Starter
    
*   18g Salt
    

Mix until it is consistent (probably for about 4-6 minutes).

Bulk until 10% rise in volume with 3 stretch and folds

*   As a guide, here’s how long this step took for others when they used the 10% inoculation version of this recipe at their room temp:
    
    *   18°C / 64°F = 9 hours
        
    *   24°C / 75°F = 6 hours
        
    *   26°C / 79°F = 4 hours
        
*   Cold ferment 48 hrs
    

Room Temp proof ~3-4 hours before baking
